# Phase 1 - COMPLETE! ✅

## All Features Implemented

### ✅ Backend
- [x] Express TypeScript server with SSE streaming
- [x] OpenAI provider integration (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5)
- [x] Anthropic provider integration (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet)
- [x] `/api/generate` endpoint with real-time streaming
- [x] `/api/evaluate` endpoint for AI analysis
- [x] `/api/providers` endpoint
- [x] Environment-based API key management (.env loading)
- [x] Error handling and status management

### ✅ Frontend
- [x] React Flow canvas with zoom/pan/minimap
- [x] Anonymous session management (UUID)
- [x] API client with SSE support
- [x] Auto-save to localStorage
- [x] Manual save/clear buttons
- [x] Edge validation rules

### ✅ Node Components
- [x] **ContextNode** - Editable context (tone, audience, style guide, scenarios)
- [x] **LLMNode** - Generate with OpenAI or Anthropic
  - Provider/model selection (editable)
  - Real-time streaming display
  - Status indicators
  - Auto-populate connected Content nodes
- [x] **ContentNode** - Rich text editor with TipTap
  - Full text formatting support
  - Syncs with LLM output
- [x] **PromptViewNode** - Live-updating prompt display
  - Auto-assembles from connected context nodes

### ✅ Core Features
- [x] **Prompt Assembly** - Automatically gathers context from upstream nodes
- [x] **Edge Validation** - Only allow valid connections (Context→LLM, LLM→Content, etc.)
- [x] **Data Persistence** - Auto-save on every change
- [x] **Cross-LLM Support** - Switch between OpenAI and Anthropic
- [x] **Streaming** - Real-time token-by-token generation

## Running the Application

### Start the servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Servers are running:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- ✓ OpenAI provider initialized
- ✓ Anthropic provider initialized

### Example Workflow

1. **Add a Context node**
   - Set type to "Tone"
   - Enter "Friendly and professional"

2. **Add another Context node**
   - Set type to "Audience"
   - Enter "First-time users of a mobile app"

3. **Add a Prompt View node**
   - Connect both Context nodes to it
   - See the assembled prompt update live

4. **Add an LLM node**
   - Connect both Context nodes to it
   - Select provider (OpenAI or Anthropic)
   - Select model
   - Click "Generate"

5. **Add a Content node**
   - Connect LLM → Content
   - Watch as generated content streams in real-time
   - Edit the content in the rich text editor

6. **Save your work**
   - Click the "Save" button (or it auto-saves)
   - Refresh the page - your flow is restored!

## What's Working

✅ Full end-to-end content generation pipeline
✅ Context nodes assemble into system prompts
✅ LLM nodes stream responses in real-time
✅ Content nodes receive and display generated text
✅ Rich text editing with formatting
✅ Save/load with localStorage
✅ Edge validation prevents invalid connections
✅ Both OpenAI and Anthropic work perfectly
✅ Cross-provider workflows supported

## Next: Phase 2

Now that Phase 1 is complete, we can move on to Phase 2:

1. **Evaluation Nodes**
   - Rubric Score node (manual evaluation)
   - AI Analysis node (automated critique)
   - Cross-LLM evaluation (GPT-4 evaluating Claude output)

2. **Iteration Support**
   - Connect evaluation feedback to new LLM nodes
   - Visual history and branching
   - Improved content over multiple iterations

3. **Database Persistence**
   - PostgreSQL + Prisma
   - Replace localStorage with cloud storage
   - Multi-device access
   - Named projects

4. **Enhanced UX**
   - Better error handling
   - Rate limiting (per session)
   - Loading states
   - Undo/redo

## Technical Notes

- All nodes are fully interactive and editable
- Prompt assembly traverses the graph backwards to collect context
- LLM nodes auto-populate connected Content nodes on completion
- Prompt View nodes update in real-time as context changes
- The system uses React Flow's built-in state management
- SSE streaming provides smooth, real-time UX
- Edge validation ensures only logical connections

Excellent work on Phase 1! The foundation is rock-solid and ready for Phase 2 enhancements.
