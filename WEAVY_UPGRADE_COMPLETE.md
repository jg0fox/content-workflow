# Weavy-Inspired UI Upgrade - Complete! ‚úÖ

## What Was Fixed

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix
**LLM ‚Üí Content Data Flow** - Fixed the issue where generated content wasn't populating Content Editor nodes. The problem was multiple `setNodes` calls causing stale state. Now consolidates updates in a single pass.

### üîÑ Connection System
**Universal Connectivity** - Removed restrictive connection validation. Now ANY node can connect to ANY other node (except self-loops). This gives users complete freedom to experiment with workflows.

### üé® Visual Transformation

**Dark Theme (Weavy-style)**
- Canvas background: #1a1a1a
- Node backgrounds: #2a2a2a
- Rounded corners: 12px
- Accent colors maintained per node type
- Improved contrast for readability

**Handle Repositioning**
- **Before**: Top (input) / Bottom (output) - confusing vertical flow
- **After**: Left (input) / Right (output) - clear horizontal flow like Weavy
- Context: Right output only
- LLM: Left input, Right output
- Content: Left input, Right output
- Prompt View: Left input only

**Connection Styling**
- Smooth bezier curves
- Purple (#9B59B6) with glow effect
- Animated dashes while dragging
- Drop shadow for depth

**Handle Improvements**
- Larger size: 12px (up from 8px)
- Colored to match node type
- Scale to 1.3x on hover
- Glow effect on hover
- Better visual feedback

**Node Effects**
- Subtle elevation shadow
- Lift on hover (translateY -1px)
- Smooth 200ms transitions
- Selected state with purple glow
- Better visual hierarchy

**Controls & MiniMap**
- Dark themed to match canvas
- Proper contrast
- Rounded corners
- Cohesive design

### üìç Smart Positioning
**Before**: Random placement causing overlaps
**After**:
- First node at (100, 100)
- Each new node: +300px right, +50px down
- Creates natural left-to-right workflow
- No more overlapping nodes
